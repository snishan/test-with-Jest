# Next.js Jest Testing Project

This is a **Next.js** project set up to demonstrate testing with **Jest**. It was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies using **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project in action.

### 3. Run Tests with Jest

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

The tests will run using **Jest**, and you'll be able to see the results directly in your terminal.

## Project Structure

- **`app/page.tsx`**: This is the main page component where you can edit and see the project in action.
